# Spreadsheet-bot-for-discord
Discord bot that reads values from google sheets and posts them on a server upon request. Part of a project for OAMK

This bot was created for a project for Oulu University of Applied Sciences. We used it for reading a spreadsheet where we stored values using a raspberryPI.
Sources for this bot were: https://discordjs.guide/preparations/ and https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs
